The puzzle appears regularly in the Sunday Telegraph (UK) and
irregularly in Games Magazine (US).  It is also very popular in Japan.
Our experience is that most puzzles set for humans can be solved by
constraint propagation alone.  However the second solution problem:
i.e. find a second solution to a puzzle given a first one, is known to
be NP-complete.  The regular puzzle must be also, but we have not seen
a reference that confirms that fact.
