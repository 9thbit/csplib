<P>Walter Hower originally proposed this problem as a benchmark in the <A
HREF="http://4c.ucc.ie/web/archive/index.jsp">Constraints Archive</a>.
He claims it has several interesting features: it concerns higher-ary
constraints (not just binary ones), it is a real-world problem, it is
not too complex, and it shows that local pre-processing may have
little or no effect.
