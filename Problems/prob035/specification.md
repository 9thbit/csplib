Molnar originally posed the following problem to construct two <em>k</em> x 
<em>k</em> matrices such that:
<pre>
     /a_11 ... a_1k\            /(a_11)^2 ... (a_1k)^2\
det ( ...  ... ...  ) = 1, det (    ...   ...    ...   ) = +/- 1
     \a_k1 ... a_kk/            \\(a_k1)^2 ... (a_kk)^2/
</pre>

where the <em>a_ii</em> are integers not equal to plus or minus 1, and `det'
denotes the <A HREF="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Determinant.html">determinant</A>
of a matrix. The solutions to this problem are significant in classifying certain types
of topological spaces. Guy discusses a variant where 0 entries are also
disallowed and the sign of both determinants must be positive.
