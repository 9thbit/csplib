Probably the first appearance of the 3-fractions puzzle in the
constraints literature is:

The following paper shows how a basic model of the 3-fractions puzzle can be
improved automatically:

Using hand-reformulation, the following paper discusses how different
using symmetry-breaking schemes on the 3-fractions puzzle, followed by
the derivation of implied constraints, can lead to models of varying
quality.
