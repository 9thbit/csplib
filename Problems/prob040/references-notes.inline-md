The original paper on the control of single stocking points with
linear holding and fixed ordering costs, and dynamic deterministic
demand is due to Wagner and Whitin cite{wagner1958dynamic}.

Clark and Scarf introduce the *echelon stock* concept and
give an alternative formulation for the arborescent systems cite{clark1960optimal}.


Crowston et al. define the *echelon holding cost* to replace
the usual holding costs and hence improve the relevance of the
Clark-Scarf model cite{crowston1973economic}.


Schwarz and Schrage give a proof for serial systems that an
alternative formulation is possible by means of *echelon stock* and *echelon holding cost* cite{schwarz1978note}.

Tarim and Miguel extend Schwarz and Schrage's proof for serial
systems to arborescent systems and examine the computational
efficiency of introducing various implied constraints into MIP
(mixed-integer programming) and constraint programming/linear
programming (CP/LP) hybrid models cite{tarim2004echelon}

control can be found in cite{graves1993logistics}:
