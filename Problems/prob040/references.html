The original paper on the control of single stocking points with
linear holding and fixed ordering costs, and dynamic deterministic
demand is due to Wagner and Whitin.

Clark and Scarf introduce the &quot;echelon stock&quot; concept and
give an alternative formulation for the arborescent systems.

Crowston et al. define the &quot;echelon holding cost&quot; to replace
the usual holding costs and hence improve the relevance of the
Clark-Scarf model.

Schwarz and Schrage give a proof for serial systems that an
alternative formulation is possible by means of &quot;echelon
stock&quot; and &quot;echelon holding cost&quot;.

<p>Tarim and Miguel extend Schwarz and Schrage's proof for serial
systems to arborescent systems and examine the computational

(mixed-integer programming) and constraint programming/linear
