    The magic hexagon was found in 1895 after much trial
and error by
<a href="http://www.johnrausch.com/PuzzleWorld/magichex.htm">William Radcliffe</a>. 
</p>

<p>
In 1963, Charles Trigg
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MagicHexagon.html"> proved</a>
that it is the only magic hexagon of any size (other
than the trivial diameter 1) using a constraint on the sum
of any diagonal.
