The magic hexagon was found in 1895 after much trial and error by William Radcliffe cite{radcliffe}.

In 1963, Charles Trigg cite{trigg} proved that it is the only magic hexagon of any size (other than the trivial diameter 1) using a constraint on the sum of any diagonal.

See the related [magic square and sequence](/Problems/prob019) problem entry.
