question</A>
posted to sci.op-research by bigwind777@aol.com (Bigwind777) in May 1998.
It is a generalisation of the problem of constructing a
round-robin tournament schedule, where the number
of players in a "game" is
more than two. The optimal solution for 32 golfers is not yet known.

Clearly, since a golfer plays with 3 new people each week, the schedule
cannot exceed 10 weeks.  The best solution of which I am aware is from
Stefano Novello (<a href="mailto:S.Novello@ic.ac.uk">
S.Novello@ic.ac.uk</a>) who posted a 9-week
<a href="solution">solution</a>, along
with the
<A HREF="http://www.icparc.ic.ac.uk/eclipse/examples/golf.pl.txt">
source</A>
of the ECLiPSe program used to find it.
The ``challenge'' therefore
is to find a 10-week solution, or prove none exists.
