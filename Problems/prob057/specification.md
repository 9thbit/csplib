Title: Killer Sudoku
Proposer: Peter Nightingale
Category: Games and puzzles

Killer Sudoku is a puzzle played on a $\\{9\times 9\\}$ grid containing 81 cells. 
The cells are filled in with numbers from the set $\\{1\ldots 9\\}$.
Each row and column must contain all numbers $\\{1\ldots 9\\}$. Each of the 9
non-overlapping $3\times 3$ subsquares (named *boxes*) must also contain all numbers $\\{1\ldots 9\\}$.

Each Killer Sudoku puzzle has a set of *cages*. A cage is a set of contiguous cells
and a total; the numbers in the cells must add up to the total. Also, the cells in
a cage cannot contain the same number more than once. The cages do not overlap, 
and they cover all cells. 
Typically a Killer Sudoku puzzle will have exactly one solution. 

An example Killer Sudoku puzzle is shown below. Each cage is shown as an area of one colour.
