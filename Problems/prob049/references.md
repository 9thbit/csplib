I saw this problem for the first time in the rec.puzzle newsgroup (in 1993 if I remember well).

The interested reader can have a look at the "Partition Problem" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem). It is not the same problem but it mentions the above heuristics.

A local search procedure is described in: P. Codognet and D. Diaz. “Yet Another Local Search Method for Constraint Solving”. Stochastic Algorithms, Foundations and Applications (SAGA), Berlin, Germany, 2001.
